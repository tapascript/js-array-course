This file contains the tasks that you need to perform to practise the concepts learned from the course. Please spend some time practising; otherwise, all the time you spend learning something will be a complete waste.

> Please Note: These tasks are for your practice. If you are stuck, go back to the videos and get the clarifications. If you are still stuck, feel free to start a conversation on [tapaScript Discord](https://discord.gg/HHwdF8r28m).
