# Tasks

This file contains the tasks that you need to perform to practise the concepts learned from the course. Please spend some time practising; otherwise, all the time you spend learning something will be a complete waste.

> Please Note: These tasks are for your practice. If you are stuck, go back to the videos and get the clarifications. If you are still stuck, feel free to start a conversation on [tapaScript Discord](https://discord.gg/HHwdF8r28m).



- [ ] **T-001**: Create an array of 5 elements using the Array Constructor.
- [ ] **T-002**: Create an array of 3 empty slots.
- [ ] **T-003**: Create an array of 6 elements using the Array literals and access the fourth element in the array using its `length` property.
- [ ] **T-004**: Use the `for` loop on the above array to print elements in the odd index.
- [ ] **T-005**: Add one element at the front and the end of an array.
- [ ] **T-006**: Remove an element from the front and the end of an array.
- [ ] **T-007**: Create an array containing the name of your favourite foods(10 foods). Destructure the 6th food element from the array using destructuring.
- [ ] **T-008**: Take out the last 8 food items from the above array using the Array destructuring. Hint: rest parameter.
- [ ] **T-009**: Clone an Array(Shallow cloning)
- [ ] **T-010**: Empty an array using its length property
- [ ] **T-011**: Create an array of 10 elements(number 1 to 10). Resize the array to length 6 once you find the number 5 in that array. Hint: Use `for-loop`.
- [ ] **T-012**: Create an Array of 10 elements. Use the `splice()` method to empty the array.
- [ ] **T-013**: Create an Array of 10 elements. You can empty the array in multiple ways: using the `length` property, using the `pop()` method, using the `shift()` method, setting the array with `[]`, or the `splice()` method. Which among these methods are most efficient and why?
- [ ] **T-014**: What happens when you concatenate two empty arrays?
- [ ] **T-015**: How can you check if a value is partially matching with any of the elements of an Array?
- [ ] **T-016**: What is the difference between the slice() and splice() methods?
- [ ] **T-017**: Create an Array of alphanumeric strings. Sort the elements in both ascending and descending orders. You must be doing this in an immutable way such that the source array never gets modified.
- [ ] **T-018**: Can you give examples of sparse and dense arrays?
- [ ] **T-019**: Give a practical usages of the .fill() method
- [ ] **T-020**: How to convert an array to a string?
